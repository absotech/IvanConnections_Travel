## üîë Configuration

### Add Your Google Maps API Key

Before you can build and run the app, you **must add your own Google Maps API Key**. The key included in the repository is a placeholder and will not work.

1.  **Get a free API Key from Google Cloud:**
    * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    * Create a new project or select an existing one.
    * In the navigation menu, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
    * Search for and enable the **Maps SDK for Android**.
    * Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    * Click **Create Credentials** and select **API key**.
    * Copy your new API key. It's highly recommended to restrict your key to your app's package name and SHA-1 certificate fingerprint for security.

2.  **Add the key to the app:**
    * In Visual Studio, open the `Platforms/Android/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
    * Find the following `<meta-data>` line:
        ```xml
        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="AIzaSyA4c5kBPQtS-vpB04O6EegQK2zVuKd2G98" />
        ```
    * Replace the placeholder value `AIzaSyA...` with **your own API key**.

3.  **Build and Run:**
    * Set the Android project as the startup project.
    * Deploy to an emulator or a connected Android device.

## üß© API Format

The app consumes data in this JSON format from a REST API:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 111,
    "label": "1051",
    "latitude": 47.1052899,
    "longitude": 27.5597816,
    "timestamp": "2025-04-10T13:53:15",
    "vehicleType": 3,
    "bikeAccessible": "BIKE_INACCESSIBLE",
    "wheelchairAccessible": "WHEELCHAIR_ACCESSIBLE",
    "speed": 21,
    "direction": 1.75,
    "localTimestamp": "2025-04-10T16:53:15",
    "routeShortName": "27",
    "tripHeadsign": "TƒÉtƒÉra»ôi Nord",
    "routeColor": "#a2238e",
    "isElectricBus": false,
    "isNewTram": false
  }
]
```
Vehicle Model

In the app, this data is mapped to the following C# class:
```bash
public class Vehicle
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string? Label { get; set; }
    public double? Latitude { get; set; }
    public double? Longitude { get; set; }
    public DateTime? Timestamp { get; set; }
    public VehicleType? VehicleType { get; set; }
    public string? BikeAccessible { get; set; }
    public string? WheelchairAccessible { get; set; }
    public int? Speed { get; set; }
    public double? Direction { get; set; }
    public DateTime? LocalTimestamp { get; set; }
    public string? RouteShortName { get; set; }
    public string? TripHeadsign { get; set; }
    public string? RouteColor { get; set; }
    public bool IsElectricBus { get; set; }
    public bool IsNewTram { get; set; }
}
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è If you're building your own API, just return a JSON array of vehicles like above.
